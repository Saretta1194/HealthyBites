## Design and User Experience

### Design
The website follows a clean and modern aesthetic, with a focus on usability and accessibility. A soft color palette and visually appealing images create a welcoming environment.
I used Poppins and Roboto for the fonts.

## Layout

There are three pages: Home page, Recipes and About.
In each page we have a responsive navbar on top and a footer with social media links and a coopyright section.
